# Face Detection :

## Overview
The Face Detection project utilizes computer vision technology to automatically detect and localize human faces in digital images. This project is built using Python and leverages the OpenCV library for face detection. The Streamlit library is employed for creating a user-friendly web application interface.

## Features
- **Web Application:** Utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly web application.
- **File Upload:** Allows users to upload images for face detection.
- **Face Detection:** Uses the Haar Cascade classifier for identifying and drawing rectangles around detected faces.
- **Preview:** Provides a preview option to display the uploaded image with detected faces.
- **Download:** Enables users to download the processed image with highlighted faces.

## Installation
To run the Face Detection Application locally, follow these steps:

1.	Clone the repository:

2.	Navigate to the project directory:

3.	Install the required dependencies:

4.	Run the Streamlit application:

## Usage
1.	Access the web application by opening the provided URL after running the application.

2.	Upload an image using the file uploader.

3.	Click the **"Preview"** button to see the uploaded image with detected faces.

4.	Click the **"Download"** button to download the processed image.
